                <h2>Amazon, Hyderabad, India</h2>
                <p><strong>Feb 2022 -- Apr 2022</strong></p>
                
                <h2>Expertise in RAG-based Systems:</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>During my tenure as an ERC Associate - AI Engineer at Amazon India, I showcased my expertise in building Retrieval-Augmented 
                        Generation (RAG) systems using open-source frameworks such as LlamaIndex, LangChain, Malevis, and Haystack.</li>
                    <li>These systems significantly streamlined workflows and enhanced model interpretability, allowing for more efficient and effective 
                        data retrieval and processing.</li>
                    <li>By leveraging these advanced frameworks, I was able to optimize the integration and functionality of AI models, ensuring that they 
                        operated with greater precision and reliability.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h2>Implementation of Generative AI Techniques:</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>One of the key highlights of my role was the implementation of Generative AI techniques to develop innovative AI workflows. These techniques 
                        resulted in a 25% reduction in model training time, which was a significant achievement in improving the efficiency of our AI processes.</li>
                    <li>The generative models not only sped up the training process but also enhanced the robustness of the models, making them more adaptable and effective 
                        in various applications. </li>
                    <li>This innovation contributed to Amazon's goal of maintaining cutting-edge AI capabilities and delivering high-quality AI solutions.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h2>Advancing AI Technologies:</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>In addition to building and implementing AI systems, I actively contributed to the advancement of AI technologies by staying updated with the latest trends 
                        and tools in the industry. I integrated cutting-edge advancements into our AI solutions to ensure optimal performance and alignment with the industry's best 
                        practices.</li>
                    <li>My commitment to continuous learning and adaptation enabled me to integrate these innovations effectively, thereby enhancing the overall performance and reliability 
                        of the AI models deployed at Amazon. </li>
                    <li>This proactive approach ensured that our AI systems remained at the forefront of technological advancements, providing Amazon with a competitive edge in the market.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h2>Collaboration and Knowledge Sharing:</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>In my role as an AI Engineer at Amazon, collaboration and knowledge sharing were integral to driving continuous improvement in AI solutions. I worked closely with cross-functional teams, 
                        including data scientists, software engineers, and product managers, to foster a collaborative environment that encouraged the exchange of ideas and expertise. </li>
                    <li>This teamwork was essential in refining AI models and ensuring they met the diverse needs of different projects. By participating in regular knowledge-sharing sessions and contributing to technical 
                        discussions, I helped to cultivate a culture of innovation and continuous learning within the team. </li>
